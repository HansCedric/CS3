			<p>
			
				The value of a proper education in the contemporary period couldn’t be understated. 
				In the Philippines, an education will open up more opportunities in this developing 
				nation and may very well be the  golden path used to traverse the great mountains of 
				poverty and gullibility that are unfortunately too often seen in the backgrounds of the 
				regular Filipino’s life.

			<p>
			
				The present Philippine Educational System is weighted down by a noticeable lack of both
				quality and quantity of acceptable educational materials and teachers. It attempts
				to teach in two languages, causing a deficiency in communicational skills in some students
				in either the lingua franca of the world (English) or our beloved mother language (Filipino).
				Furthermore, this system faces all of these problems whilst being strangled at the neck by a 
				low government budget.

			</span>
			
			<p>
			
				A rotten educational system will be the greatest hindrance in our nation’s ascension. Without a
				system of education that cultivates a strong middle class, our country will be plagued by poverty,
				uncertainty, and ignorance. If we don’t act now, we will be undergoing troubling times that will
				intensify with every second of inaction that passes.
