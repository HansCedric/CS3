							<h1> Better Standards + </h1> </li>
					
							<p>
						
								The policies and programs in the education structure should be developed to aim higher achievement standards and goals. Standards are formal documents that establish uniform education criteria, 
								methods, processes, and practices developed through an accredited consensus process. Standards should be developed based on guiding principles of openness, balance, consensus, and due process 
								and should be duly established in order to meet technical, safety, regulatory, societal, and market needs and should also be catalysts for technological innovation and global market competition.

							<h1> More Accountability + </h1> </li>			

							<p>
								The institutions, the educators, the managements are the people who provide instructions, curriculum, and demonstration to the students and thus pave way for results. There should be an accountability strategy
								under which the institutions showing remarkable results should be rewarded and those with poorer results should be penalized.

						<h1> Parent Involvement + </h1> </li>
						
						<p>
						
							Overall, research has consistently shown that parental involvement in children’s education does make a positive difference to pupils’ achievement. Most children have two main educators in their lives – their parents and their 
							teachers. Parents are the prime educators until the child attends an early year setting or starts school and they remain a major influence on their children’s learning throughout school and beyond. The school and parents both
							have crucial roles to play.
